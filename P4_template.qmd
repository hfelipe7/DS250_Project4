## Elevator pitch
_A SHORT (2-3 SENTENCES) PARAGRAPH THAT `DESCRIBES KEY INSIGHTS` TAKEN FROM METRICS IN THE PROJECT RESULTS THINK TOP OR MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS._ (Note: this is not a summary of the project, but a summary of the results.)

_A Client has requested this analysis and this is your one shot of what you would say to your boss in a 2 min elevator ride before he takes your report and hands it to the client._

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and `before1980`.__ Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”.__ Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.
